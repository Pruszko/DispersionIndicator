# Relations between reticles, reticle types, gun marker types, gun marker names, marker linkages and data providers are:
# - each reticle type has one or two reticles (gun marker type): client and/or server ones
# - each gun marker type has one data provider
# - client and server gun marker types of one reticle type have one shared set of gun marker names (in vanilla game)
# - each gun marker name is bound to one marker linkage
# - marker linkage can be used multiple times and determines properties of vanilla reticle
#
# For us, there must be 2 reticles (or at least one client-side) for each reticle type (one gun marker names set),
# because vanilla reticles does this trick:
# - when we start auto-aiming, vanilla server reticle (if "Use server aim" is checked) becomes client reticle
#     but still uses same gun marker names
#     in result, it "inherits" server reticle markers, without recreating it
# - vanilla simple _DevControlMarkersFactory (the one displaying both client and server reticles) violates this
#     by assigning its one set of gun marker names to client reticle
#     and use separate gun marker names for vanilla server reticle
#     but this results in server reticle being destroyed/created on auto-aiming
#     due to gunMarkerFlag.serverMode becoming False
#     which is undesirable for us
#
# We don't want to destroy/create markers for several reasons (written at the end)
# so to avoid this, following code contract is made:
# - all server reticles (vanilla or our custom ones) must have client reticle counterpart
#     and become those client reticles on auto-aiming by sharing same gun marker names
#     so when auto-aiming (gunMarkerFlags.serverMode becomes False), they will "inherit" those gun markers
#     from server reticle, without recreating it
#     this is done by DispersionGunMarkersDecorator
# - all necessary reticle instances selected in config MUST be present all the time
#     to maintain exact rendering order, even if gunMarkerFlags.serverMode becomes False to avoid destroying them
# - when config is changed, all markers MUST be fully destroyed and created again in our defined rendering order
# - standard gun marker invalidation process MUST NOT be changed
#     but also MUST result in unchanged gun markers set (at least for reticles that are important for us)
#
# Marker destroy/create approach has several drawbacks:
# - (noticeable, unfixable) when playing Czech light tanks, yellow cross marker would be temporarily displayed
#     on marker creation with alpha 1.0
#     and we CANNOT fix this, because WG.CrosshairFlash has its script object (BW::ScriptObject)
#     inside BigWorld engine and that yellow cross marker fading logic is somewhere there, inaccessible
#     if we try to instantly fade its alpha externally (by using DAAPI's MovieClip and accessing it via public props)
#     then BW::ScriptObject for some reason loses control over it, resulting in absent yellow marker permanently
# - (big, awkward to fix) when auto-aiming, server reticles would have to be destroyed without client-side counterpart
#     because in DispersionGunMarkersDecorator we cannot easily distinguish client-side update from server-side one
#     without different gun marker type passed as parameter
# - (small, partially fixable) when aiming at vehicle and clicking auto-aim, penetration indicator becomes red
#     it is fixable by invalidating its cache, but will still result in one rendering frame of invalid state
# - (small, unfixable) when auto-aiming, full destroy/create of markers would blink for one rendering frame
#     because during one frame they wouldn't be present yet
# - (small, unfixable) game rarely randomly invalidates gun marker set (saw that sometimes, but don't know the reason)
#     which would result in random destroy/create of markers what can be perceived as blinking reticle
